# ESP8266 Industrial Digital & Analog I/O Control Gateway

## Overview

This project is an **ESP8266-based industrial I/O control gateway** designed to interface with digital and analog field signals in an industrial environment.

The design emphasizes:

* Robust hardware architecture
* Manufacturability
* Clear fabrication and assembly documentation

> **Note:** Source schematics, BOM, firmware source code, and native PCB design files are intentionally not published to protect intellectual property.
